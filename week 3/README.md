# Week 3

This week was all about the common manipulations performed on satellite images. There are two notebooks in this week's notes:

1. [Introduction to image operations.ipynb](./Introduction%20to%20image%20operations.ipynb) is the notebook given to us to demonstrate the manipulations. This notebook also contains the notes I took as I followed along.
2. [assignment.ipynb](./assignment.ipynb) is my notebook with the assignment exercises.

There is also a [folder](./images/) that contains all the images that are used and a [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file containing the required dependencies.

The notebooks can be run anywhere you typically run your notebooks.
